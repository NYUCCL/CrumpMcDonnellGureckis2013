	<h1>Instructions</h1>
        <p>After using all of your credits, you will be tested on <b>each</b>
        of the eight items you have seen.</p>
        <p>You will try your best to respond with the category label that you
        have seen previously. To give a response, you would click 'A' button
        for a square whose label is A. You would click the 'B' button if the
        square was originally labeled 'B'. </p>
        <p>After giving eight responses, you will recieve feedback on how you
        responded and loop back to learning the same squares you have seen
        previously again. In order to finish the experiment, you must
        succesfully complete two test phases at 100% accuracy. (E.g., the best
        possible performance would be two blocks of label phases and test
        phases). The experiment will loop until you can get two test phases
        completely right in a row.</p>
