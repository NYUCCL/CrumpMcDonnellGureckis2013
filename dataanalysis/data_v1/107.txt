rulestrategy:At first I looked for a pattern to determine if it was A or B, but I had a hard time figuring it out.  I have a very good memory (when not distracted), so on the second test I decided to simply memorize the combinations (ie: yellow background, dots, and no slash = B, or white background, no dots, slash = A, etc).  The combinations were shown twice during the learning phase, which helped me memorize them.  During the test phase I simply recalled from memory the pattern to chose the correct letter.  It worked, so that's how I did it on the final test.  I suspect that this is not how it is supposed to be done (there is a pattern, it shouldn't be done from memory), but this is how I accomplished it.
