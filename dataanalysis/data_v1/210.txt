rulestrategy:I found that the opposite color pairs had opposite letters. For example, the blue smooth line was a so the purple smooth line was b. In the same sense, the purple rough was b and the blue dotted was a. It was a matter of remembering only one, that way you knew the other color was the opposite letter.
