rulestrategy:I look at the one in the red box and repeat to myself the colors. Ex: Yellow (border), Purple (background colors), Dots, slash. Or White, purple, smooth. Then I would look at the next one and count the similarities between that one and the previous. If it is in the same category, then it's because at least one of those similarities. If it is not in the same category, then it's because of at least one of the differences, and their similarities do not cause them to be in the same group and do not need to be considered in the following selections. So one should know what the grouping is in the first 3-4 boxes. I messed up on the first one cause I got the letters mixed up. But I got 100% wrong! :-)
howtoimprove:Well, I thought it was good. But then it didn't get any more difficult. I was mentally prepared for it to get more difficult, like including the blue color, or making it so two things caused them to be in one category or the other.  So I hope it is good for what you needed, but as a "player" I was disappointed. Because of the nature of the game, I think you could make it longer and actually harder; people will still play, and you could get more information.
