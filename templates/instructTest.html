		During the task, you will view object presented one at a time and you
		will be asked to judge the group membership.  The screen will look something like
		this:</p>
    <div id="testexample">
        <img id="stim" width="100" src="static/images/STIM03.png">
        <div id="query">
            <p id="prompt">Which group does the object belong to?</p>
            <div id="inputs">
                <input type="button" value="A" id="CategoryA" onClick="alert('You have chosen A! In the real experiment, we would tell you if you were right or wrong.')" />
                <input type="button" value="B" id="CategoryB" onClick="alert('You have chosen B! In the real experiment, we would tell you if you were right or wrong.')"  />
            </div>
        </div>
    </div>
	<p>Try your best to respond with the correct group name for that
	particular object. To give a response, you simply click the button
	corresponding to the label you think is associated with the object. 
	Afterwards you will receive feedback about the correct membership.
	Try it out above!  </p> 
	
	<p>The experiment is organized into rounds of 16 test trials. At the end of
    each round of trials, you will learn what your average score was. Then you
    will go on to another round where you will get to make guesses about the
    items again. Your objective is to get 100% correct in two blocks in a row.
    The rule <strong>will not change</strong> from round to round.</p>
