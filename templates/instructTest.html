    <p>After using all of your credits, you will move on the test phase.
    During each test phase you will be tested on objects presented individually. The screen will look something like this:</p>
    <div id="testexample">
        <img id="stim" width="100" src="static/images/STIM10.PNG">
        <div id="query">
            <p id="prompt">Which group does the object belong to?</p>
            <div id="inputs">
                <input type="button" value="A" id="CategoryA" onClick="alert('You have chosen A! In the real experiment, we would continue on to the next square.')" />
                <input type="button" value="B" id="CategoryB" onClick="alert('You have chosen B! In the real experiment, we would continue on to the next square.')"  />
            </div>
        </div>
    </div>
    <p>In the test phase, try your best to respond with the correct label or group name
    for that particular object. To
    give a response, you simply click the button corresponding to the label you
    think is associated with the object.  Try it out above!  </p>
    <p>At the end of the test phase,
    you will receive feedback on how well you did, and (if you have not yet
    mastered the grouping) then you will go back to the learning phase to
    continue your learning. </p>
    <div class="instructions">When you're ready to continue, press <strong>Next</strong>.</div>
    <input type="button" class="continue" id="Next" value="Next">
