	<h1>Instructions</h1>
	<p>Before starting the experiment, we would like to request that you try your
	best remove <strong class="warm">all</strong> possible sources
	of distraction.</p>
	<p>Please turn off any external noise source (e.g. music,
	television), close all other windows open on your computer, ask other people
	to leave your immediate environment or to not distract you, and to
	concentrate on the experiment at hand. Evidence that you have not followed
	these instructions (for example, excessively long response times) could lead to revocation
	of payment.</p>
	<p>Most importantly, <strong class="warm">please do not</strong> use any
	writing or drawings (or your computer) to help you remember.  We are cognitive psychologists
	interested in how people learn using only their memory. We rely on your honesty for
	this.   Please try to
	remember which group name goes which each object on your own.  While the task may be
	difficult at first, it will get easier as you go, and it is possible to master the groups after a few minutes.</p>

		<h2 class="warm">To review:</h2>
		<p><em> You will be learning whether the square objects belong to either
			group
			<strong>A</strong> or <strong>B</strong> over the course of several
			sessions. After each session, you will be tested on your knowledge for
			the labels. To complete the task, you must get a perfect score two
			sessions in a row.</em></p>
