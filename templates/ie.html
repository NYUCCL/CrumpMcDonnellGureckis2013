    <h1>Unsupported Browser: Internet Explorer</h1>
    <p>Hi there! It looks like you're using Internet Explorer. Unfortunately
    we're unable to support Microsoft Internet Explorer right now. If you want
    to participate in the experiment, you can join in by using a
    standards-compliant browser such as 
    <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/firefox">Firefox</a> or 
    <a href="http://google.com/chrome">Google Chrome</a>.</p>
