	<p>
		The experiment will be divided into two, repeating phases.  In the first
		phase, you will learn about the items.  In the second phase, we will test
		your memory for which items go in which group.
	</p>
	<p>
		To get you used to the learning phase, on the next instruction screen, you will 
		see an example training screen. You will be
		able to see all of the items you need to learn about. At any given time,
		one item, indicated by a red box, will be available for you to observe. You
		can click on it to see its label or group name.
	</p>
	<p>
		You will only get 16 chances to click on items in each learning phase. These will be ticked off on a
		display in the bottom of the screen.
	</p>	
	<p>
		As you will see, the objects may move around on the screen periodically.
