	    <h1>Learning Groups of Objects</h1>
	    <p class="warm">Hello there! Thank you for taking the time to participate in this experiment. Below is a consent form that describes the nature of the experiment, what to expect, and how you will be measured. Please take the time to read this over before deciding to participate in this experiment.</p>
	    <div class="legal">
		<p>You have been invited to take part in a research study named Active
		Learning. The study is designed to investigate how people learn in
		dynamic tasks. It will be conducted by Professor Todd M. Gureckis who
		is the principal investigator, at the Department of Psychology, Faculty
		of Arts & Science, New York University.</p>
		<p>If you agree to be in this study, you will be asked to look at
		pictures of objects (e.g., geometric figures or photographs of everyday
		objects) presented on a computer display and make judgments about them.
		Participation in this study will take about fifteen minutes to
		complete, and you will receive $2.00 and a bonus of up to $2.50 for
		your participation. When you complete the study, a thorough verbal and
		written explanation of it will be provided. In addition, by agreeing to
		participate, you understand you must be 18 years or older to
		participate</p>
		<p>There are no known risks associated with your participation in this
		research beyond those of everyday life. Although you will receive no
		direct benefits, this research may help the investigator understand how
		people learn new categories.</p>
		<p>Confidentiality of your research records will be strictly
		maintained. We assign code numbers to each participant so that data is
		never directly linked to individual identity, and we are interested in
		group results rather than the responses of particular individuals. Data
		are kept in our laboratory and are only viewed by the investigators.
		These data files are kept on our computer indefinitely.</p>
		<p>Taking part in this study is voluntary. Not taking part or
		withdrawing after the study has begun will result in no loss of
		services from NYU to which you are otherwise entitled. You have the
		right to skip or not answer any questions you prefer not to answer.</p>
		<p>If there is anything about the study or your participation that is
		unclear or that you do not understand, if you have questions or wish to
		report a research-related problem, you may contact the principal
		investigator, Todd M. Gureckis at 6 Washington Place (409), New York,
		NY, 10003, (212) 998-3794, todd.gureckis@nyu.edu. For questions about
		your rights as a research participant, you may contact the
			University Committee on Activities Involving Human Subjects, New
			York University, 665 Broadway, Suite 804, New York, NY 10012, at
			ask.humansubjects@nyu.edu or (212) 998-4808.</p>
