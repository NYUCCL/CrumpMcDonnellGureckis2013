    <h1>Instructions</h1>
    <p>Due to the online nature of this experiment, we want to best
    simulate a lab-like setting. We would like to request that you best
    remove yourself from <strong class="warm">all</strong> distraction.</p>
    <p>We ask that you turn off any external noise source (e.g. music,
    television), close all other windows open on your computer, ask other
    people to leave your immediate environment or to not distract you, and
    to simply concentrate on the experiment at hand. Evidence that you have
    not followed these instructions could lead to revocation of
    payment.</p>
    <p>Most importantly, you may <strong class="warm">not</strong> use any
    assisitive learning aids such as writing down or drawing labels to help
    you remember. You must pay enough attention so you will be able to
    remember the labels on your own.</p> 
    <div class="subbox">
        <h2 class="warm">To review:</h2>
        <p><em> You will learning whether the squares belong to 'A' or 'B' over
        the course of several sessions. After each session, you will be
        tested on your knowledge for the labels. To complete the task, you
        must get a perfect score two sessions in a row.</em</p>
