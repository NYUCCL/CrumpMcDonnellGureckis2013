		<p>Thank you for your participation in our study!  Your anonymous data makes an
		important contribution to our understanding of human learning and memory. </p>

		<p>The goal of the study was to understand how people form categories and learn
		to make effective decisions in tasks where they must actively explore the
		environment. In the task you may have been asked (depending on condition) to
		design “queries” to figure out an unknown concept.  In other conditions you may
		have passively viewed stimuli belonging to two or more categories.</p>

		<p>The goal of our research is to better understand the way people learn
		categories and how they explore their environment in order to learn.  In
		addition we are interested in contrasting “active”, self-directed learning
		against more passive modes of learning.  This research has potential
		implications for education (understanding the best way to teach people novel
		concepts).  In addition, we are interested in understanding how people design
		“queries” or “questions” about things they want to learn about.</p>

		<p>If you are interested in this research, we recommend that you take a look at
		the following topics in an introductory psychology textbook: categorization,
		decision making, neuroeconomics, and reinforcement learning.</p>

		<p>If you have any questions about this research, you may contact the
		principal investigator, Todd M. Gureckis at 6 Washington Place (859), New
		York, NY, 10003 or email him at <a
