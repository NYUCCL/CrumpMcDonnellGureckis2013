	<h1>Instructions</h1>
	<p>In this experiment, you will be looking at various squares that differ on a number of different features. Your task is to try your best to remember the label, <b>A</b> or <b>B</b>, of each of the randomly arranged eight squares. You will later be tested on the labels of these squares.</p>
	<p>In order to view the label of the square, you must click on the square itself. The label will appear for half of one second and then disappear. You will be able to make 16 such queries in each block, as represented by the credit counter on the bottom of the screen. Every time you query the label of a square, you lose one credit from the counter.</p>
	<p>You are free to select any category label you wish to see. Remember, you will be subsequently tested on the squares you have seen, so try to use your samples as an opportunity to learn as much as you can about the category labels. </p>
